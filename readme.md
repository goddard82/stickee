This is my attempt at the Magpie PHP Developer Challenge, but in Python.

Whilst looking at the data scraped from the html, it became obvious that there were many different formats of shipping date. I believe I've shown handling of these cases, using regex.

Given time I would:

* Add tests for the functions
* Make the handling of shipping dates etc more open, and not tied to specific conditions
* Make sure that any other cases of repeated products are handled, not just check by title
